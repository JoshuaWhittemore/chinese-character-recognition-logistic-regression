## Notes
<br>
1. This is a 'proof of concept' notebook to show that logistic regression is one way to classify Chinese characters.
<br><br>
2. This might be a good starting point for beginners.  Other ways will certainly work better - in particular a convolutional neural network.
<br><br>
3. The dataset used in this notebook was collected by __Ryan Harper__ and presented by __Matt Borthwick__ at an informal meetup of the __[Portland Data Science Group](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Data-Science-Group/)__  that Matt organized.
<br><br>
4. There is a good walkthrough of applying logistic regression to the classic MNIST dataset __[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-using-python-sklearn-numpy-mnist-handwriting-recognition-matplotlib-a6b31e2b166a)__.  It's a very similar task to recognizing Chinese characters.
